# NEL1_2
NEL1 code

Starting on Apr 29 2019, to upgrade NEL1 from XP to W7
XP: NEL 1_1
W7: NEL 1_2 (started by copying just code of NEL1_1; then will upgrade to W7/MATLAB/NI, using Mark's version as a reference, but going from our code so we know ALL changes).

Philosophy: Standard NEL handles the top two RP2s (that is controlling mix/sel and generating trigger, and stim playing). Bottom rack (RP2 #3&4 or RX8) is handled separately (for data collection & inv calib filtering).
